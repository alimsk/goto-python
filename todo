- already done
* not done

- implicit pop/push block
- error if jump into for/with block
* remove "goto" and "label" in co_names and remap its reference
* support labeled for/while, and break specific label
* refactor code, use generator instead of buffer so it can be more efficient and fast ofc
* more detailed error message, e.g "label 'x' is not defined in this function. at line 14"
