- already done
* not done
! can't be done
? not sure

- implicit pop/push block
- error if jump into for/with block
? remove "goto", "label", and label names from co_names, then remap other references
! support labeled for/while, and break/continue specific label, this can't be done because...
  ...there is no way to know if an instruction is the start of a while block
- refactor code, use generator instead of buffer so it can be more efficient and fast ofc
- more detailed error message, e.g "label 'x' is not defined in this function. at line 14"
- add comments and some docs
